# Ansible Role for Komodo

This role is designed for managing systemd deployments of the [komodo](https://github.com/moghtech/komodo) periphery agent,
minimizing permissions by creating a service user and running the service as that user.
The role supports both systemd **user** and **system** scopes; in both cases the service runs as the unprivileged `komodo` user.

The user will only have access to:
* Its configuration files
* The periphery agent binary
* Its SSL certificates for establishing a TLS connection with Komodo Core
* Its repo, stacks, and build directories, located in `komodo_user` home directory by default

In this way, it should have no more access to the host system than it would running
in a docker container. But since it is running directly on the host filesystem, it should eliminate
the numerous edge cases which appear when running it as a docker container.

## Features

1. **Install** the Komodo Periphery agent, creating and sandboxing the `komodo` user.
2. **Update** the Komodo Periphery agent by specifying a new version.
3. **Uninstall** the Komodo Periphery agent, optionally removing the `komodo` user and home directories.
4. **Manage Servers** in Komodo Core directly, so that you don't have to manually add/update them in core after deployment.

## Required Role Variables

For all role variables, see [`defaults/main.yml`](./defaults/main.yml) for more details. Below are the only required variables if you are otherwise okay with defaults.

| Variable                                  | Default               | Description                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **komodo\_action**                        | `None`                | `install`, `update`, or `uninstall`                                               |
| **komodo\_version**                       | `v1.19.5`             | Release tag, or `latest`/`core` for [automatic versioning](#automatic-versioning) |

> [!NOTE]
> `install` and `update` are almost functionally identical, except that `install`
> by default allows creation of the `komodo_user`.
> See [Komodo User Management](#komodo-user-management).

## Komodo User Management

By default, the komodo user (i.e. the user perhiphery is run as) is managed by this role, and the level of management of the `komodo_user` is influenced by the `komodo_action`

| Variable                                     | Default                                | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **allow\_create\_komodo\_user**              | `true` on `install`, otherwise `false` | Allows `komodo_user` to be created. Will be created as a service account with no login, unless the user exists already in which case it wont be touched |
| **allow\_modify\_komodo\_user**              | `true`                                 | Allows the role to enable or disable linger, when `komodo_service_scope=user`, and allows the role to add the user to the `docker` group                |
| **allow\_delete\_komodo\_user**              | `false`                                | Allows the role to delete the `komodo_user` on `komodo_action=uninstall`. This **must** be set explicitly, it is never defaulted true                   |

## Systemd Configuration

This role supports running periphery under either the systemd **user** manager (i.e. `systemctl --user start periphery`) 
or the systemd **system** manager (i.e.`systemctl start periphery`). In both cases, the service process runs as `komodo_user`.

- In **user** scope, the service is managed by the per-user systemd instance and therefore *must* run as that user. 
  To have it start at boot without a login session, **linger** will be enabled for that user (`loginctl enable-linger komodo`) if `allow_modify_komodo_user=true`,
  which is the default.
- In **system** scope, the unit is installed under the system manager and explicitly drops privileges to `komodo_user` via `User=` in the unit file.

Least-privilege is the default, so **user** scope is recommended. For a deeper comparison, see [Systemd User vs System Units](#systemd-user-vs-system-units).

| Variable                   | Default | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **komodo\_service\_scope**  | `user`  | `user` or `system`. See [Systemd User vs System Units](#systemd-user-vs-system-units). |


## Security / Authentication Variables

These variables can be set to enforce authentication, SSL, or IP whitelists between
periphery and Komodo Core. The only feature enabled by default is ssl.

| Variable                                  | Default | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **komodo\_passkeys**                      | `[]`    | List of passkeys the server will accept                                                                                      |
| **komodo\_bind\_ip**                      | `[::]`  | IP address the server binds to (`0.0.0.0` to force IPv4 only)                                                                |
| **komodo\_allowed\_ips**                  | `[]`    | IP list allowed to access periphery (empty list means all allowed)                                                           |
| **komodo\_ssl\_enabled**                  | `true`  | Enable HTTPS between core/periphery when `true`                                                                              |
| **komodo\_agent\_secrets**                | `[]`    | List (of name/value pairs) for secrets only available to the agent. See [Adding Periphery Secrets](#adding-periphery-secrets)|

## API Credentials

Some features, for example [automatic versioning](#automatic-versioning) and [server management](#server-management) require API credentials to be used.
Features which rely on API credentials, when enabled, will give an error indicating that API credentials are needed if they weren't provided.
Below are the needed credentials to access the Komodo API.

The `komodo_core_url` is just the address needed to reach komodo from the target server, *which can be different for each server if needed*. 
The remaining API credentials are generated from within Komodo core in **Settings > Profile > New Api Key +**

| Variable                       | Default                    | Description                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **komodo\_core\_url**          | `""`                       | Base URL of the Komodo Core API (e.g. `https://komodo.example.com`)                             |
| **komodo\_core\_api\_key**     | `""`                       | API key used to authenticate to Core                                                            |
| **komodo\_core\_api\_secret**  | `""`                       | Secret paired with the API key                                                                  |

> [!NOTE]
> All API Calls are delegated to localhost (and where applicable, `run_once`). This is so that komodo core does
> not need to be accessible by the remote periphery server directly. But it does mean that
> komodo core must be accessible from your ansible host.

## Server Management

When enabled and provided with API credentials / details, the role can automatically create and update servers for you. Including the ability to 
set *per-periphery* passkeys, rather than using global ones. Currently, that ability can only be done via the API. In order to use this feature, you must provide valid [API Credentials](#api-credentials)

| Variable                       | Default                    | Description                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **enable\_server\_management** | `false`                    | Allows the role to create / update servers automatically in Komodo Core                         |
| **server\_name**               | `{{ inventory_hostname }}` | Name under which the server is registered in Core.                                              |
| **server\_address**            | `""`                       | Public URL advertised to Core (auto-detected when blank)                                        |
| **server\_passkey**            | `""`                       | Passkey specific to this server (merges with `komodo_passkeys` for periphery deployment.        |
| **generate\_server\_passkey**  | `false`                    | Generate a random passkey ([See below for special notes on this](#note-on-generated-passkeys) ) |

## Additional Variables

### Systemd User vs System Units

Systemd has two distinct kinds of managers for running services.

- The **System Manager** (i.e. `systemctl`) which is directly started by the kernel as the first user-space process (PID 1).
It helps to boot the system, manages networking, other system services, etc.
- **User Managers** (i.e. `systemctl --user`) for each user on the system, which are session-scoped init systems and manage services *as the running user*

They exist side-by-side for different purposes. Some of the relevant differences for this role come down to:

- **Privilege / Isolation**: User services *must* run as the same user as the user manager. 
So privilege escalation should not be possible even with misconfiguration. Processes in user scopes should have cgroup-isolation from system services.
- **Lifecycle**: User services tie to, obviously, the users session. Running with a service account can be tricky, and it requires linger-mode to be enabled for the user
to keep the process alive after boot. It also makes debugging a little trickier, because you need to run commands from the proper runtime environment.
- **Dependency Separation**: Each manager has its *own targets and units*. So a user unit cannot (or should not) try to order after or depend on system targets.
For example, in `system` mode, we can depend on `network-online.target`, but we cannot in `user` mode.

There are many other subtle differences of course, but these are probably the main considerations when choosing which type of deployment makes the most sense for this role.

Here is a quick comparison of how exactly the services are deployed when using this role, to understand some of the implications.

|                          | **User units**                                                                                                  | **System units**                                                                      |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Manager                  | `systemctl --user`                                                                                              | `systemctl`                                                                           |
| Privilege                | *Can only* run as `komodo_user`                                                                                 | Runs as `komodo_user` via privilege-drop in the Unit file with `User={{komodo_user}}` |
| Lifecycle                | User session; requires linger mode with `loginctl enable-linger komodo` (needs `allow_modify_komodo_user=true`) | Machine boot; starts via system target `multi-user.target`                            |
| Unit locations           | `{{ komodo_home }}/.config/systemd/user/…`                                                                      | `/etc/systemd/system`                                                                 |
| Capture Logs             | `sudo -u komodo journalctl --user -u periphery`                                                                 | `journalctl -u periphery`                                                             |
| Manually Control Service | `sudo -u komodo XDG_RUNTIME_DIR="/run/user/$(id -u komodo)" systemctl start --user periphery`                   | `systemctl start periphery`                                                           |
| Targets / Ordering       | Uses `default.target`, and relies on restart policy to reliably handle startup failures                         | Uses `multi-user.target` and `After=`/`Wants=network-online.target`                   |

A rule of thumb would probably be to stick with `user` mode for home use, as it is unlikely you will be impacted by any of the complications associated with it.
Otherwise, consider `system` mode when you want to minimize friction with managing the service, and have a more reliable dependency ordering.

### Automatic Versioning

Set `komodo_version` to `latest` to determine the latest release from GitHub and install that. You can also specify `komodo_version=core` and the role will
request the currently installed version on Komodo Core, and install the matching version. In order to use `core`, you must also provide valid [API Credentials](#api-credentials)

### Note on Generated Passkeys

Enabling passkey generation for unique periphery passkeys with `generate_server_passkey=true` is potentially valuable, but if doing so remember to *always* enable
this feature whenever you update or install that server. The generated passkey is not saved, it is used to configure periphery at the time of install and then thrown away.

So for example, if you generated a random passkey on `install`, and then *DIDN'T* generate or set a passkey
on a future `update`, the role will not have knowledge of a server passkey at all, and it will simply delete the randomly generated one that was previously provided,
and it will not enforce passkey authentication, which is likely not the desired behavior. 

Basically, the simple advice is to *ALWAYS* have `generate_server_passkey=true` or *ALWAYS* have `generate_server_passkey=false` for each server. I recommend setting
these variables directly in an inventory file. See [`examples/server_management/inventory/all.yml`](./examples/server_management/inventory/all.yml) for an example.

If this is not preferred, you can always generate on install, and then record the generated passkeys and include that explicitly in your `komodo_passkeys` from thereon.
Or you can of course just always set your own randomly generated passkeys.

### Overriding default configuration templates

In some cases, it may be desirable to have more control over the exact service files and/or configuration files deployed to each periphery node.
In this case, the default / interpolated configurations and service files may not be ideal. These configurations can be overridden by manually providing
the config and/or service files and setting them in your playbook to `komodo_config_file_template` and `komodo_service_file_template`, for the
periphery configuration and the systemd service file, respectively.

Note that in doing so, the deployed files will be exactly as you specify, and they will always take precedence over any other specified variables.

### Adding Periphery Secrets

[Secrets](https://komo.do/docs/variables#defining-variables-and-secrets) can be bound directly to periphery agent in Komodo.
This can be achieved with this role by adding your secrets as a list of name/value pairs containing your variable name and its value.

For example, you could add this directly to the inventory for a particular host.

```yaml
komodo_agent_secrets:
  - name: "SECRET"
    value: "this-is-a-secret"
  - name: "ANOTHER_SECRET" 
    value: "also-a-secret"
  - name: "SUPER_SECRET"

## Basic Installation / Setup

> [!TIP]
> Before running the role, you can run it safely in dry-run more with `--check --diff`
> Note that a few tasks will error (and be ignored, not failed) in dry run mode, notably ones that require
> the existence of the `komodo_user` during `install`, because the roles is unable to
> actually create the user in a dry-run.

1. `ansible-galaxy role install bpbradley.komodo`
2. Create an `inventory/komodo.yml` file which specifies your komodo hosts and indicates the allowed_ips if desired
    ```yaml
    komodo:
        hosts:
            komodo_periphery1:
                ansible_host: 192.168.10.20
                komodo_allowed_ips:
                    - "127.0.0.1"
                komodo_bind_ip: 0.0.0.0
            komodo_periphery2:
                ansible_host: 192.168.10.21
                komodo_allowed_ips:
                    - "::ffff:192.168.10.20"
    ```
   
4. **Optional** but recommended. Set an encrypted passkey using `ansible-vault` which matches the passkey set in Komodo Core.

    ```sh
    ansible-vault encrypt_string 'supersecretpasskey'
    ```
    You will get an output like this, which we will use later. 

    ```
    !vault |
      $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
      65353234373130353539663661376563613539303866643963363830376661316638333139343366
      3563656637303235373336336131346338336634653232300a313736396336316330666237653237
      64613231323433373637313462633863613732653136366462313134393938623136326633346166
      3834333462333162310a313037306336613061313733363862633437376133316234326431633131
      35386565333538623231643433396334323132616438353839663534373030393266
    ```

    Note that you will need to now input the password you entered every time you run this role,
    or you can create a password file for automation.

    ```sh
    echo "your password" > .vault_pass
    chmod 600 .vault_pass
    ```

    Now you can call your playbook with `--vault-password-file .vault_pass`

5. Create a playbook which selects the role. You can create multiple playbooks for install/uninstall/update, or just one
playbook and control behavior with variables. Here is an example of doing it with just one playbook.

    `playbooks/komodo.yml`

    ```yaml
    ---
    - name: Manage Komodo Service
      hosts: komodo
      roles:
          - role: bpbradley.komodo
          komodo_action: "install"
          komodo_version: "latest"
          komodo_passkeys: 
            - !vault |
                $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
                65353234373130353539663661376563613539303866643963363830376661316638333139343366
                3563656637303235373336336131346338336634653232300a313736396336316330666237653237
                64613231323433373637313462633863613732653136366462313134393938623136326633346166
                3834333462333162310a313037306336613061313733363862633437376133316234326431633131
                35386565333538623231643433396334323132616438353839663534373030393266
    ```
   
6. Run the playbook

    Install using default values

    ```sh
    ansible-playbook -i inventory/komodo.yaml playbooks/komodo.yml \
    --vault-password-file .vault_pass
    ```

    Install an older version instead

    ```sh
    ansible-playbook -i inventory/komodo.yaml playbooks/komodo.yml \
    -e "komodo_version=v1.16.11" \
    --vault-password-file .vault_pass
    ```

    Update to the latest version

    ```sh
    ansible-playbook -i inventory/komodo.yaml playbooks/komodo.yml \
    -e "komodo_action=update" \
    -e "komodo_version=latest" \
    --vault-password-file .vault_pass

    ```

    Uninstall the periphery agent and all installed files, and delete the user.

    ```sh
    ansible-playbook -i inventory/komodo.yaml playbooks/komodo.yml \
    -e "komodo_action=uninstall" \
    -e "allow_delete_komodo_user=true" \
    --vault-password-file .vault_pass
    ```
